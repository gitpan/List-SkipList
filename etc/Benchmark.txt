
PERFORMANCE
    An unscientific comparison of module performance for List::SkipList
    against other pure-Perl modules, using Benchmark.pl:

                              Ordered  Reversed Random    
      Module         Version  Inserts  Inserts  Inserts   Finds    Deletes

      List::SkipList   0.50    4.04      3.59     5.02      4.19     5.06 
      Tree::RedBlack   0.3     6.23      6.09     3.77      2.93     N/A

    Numbers in seconds per 10,000 operations on a set of randomly generated
    keys on a machine running Windows XP Professional, Pentium III 795 MHz,

DETAILS
    Some of the modules in the comparison are very early versions, and
    may not be well optimized.

    Some differences should be noted for each module:

List::SkipList
    Skip lists use a non-deterministic (randomized) algorithm, so
    numbers will vary between runs.

    This module is designed to use a customizable node type, so there
    is some overhead that may degrade performance.

Tree::Smart
    Uses splay trees, which optimize themselves based on which nodes
    one uses most often.
