NAME
    List::SkipList - Perl implementation of skip lists

REQUIREMENTS
    Perl 5.6.1 is required.

    "Carp::Assert" is used for validation and debugging. (The assertions can
    be commented out if the module cannot be installed.) Otherwise standard
    modules are used.

Installation
    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL or the
    newer Build.PL methods.

    Using Makefile.PL:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use nmake instead.)

    Using Build.PL (if you have Module::Build installed):

      perl Build.PL
      perl Build
      perl Build test
      perl Build install    

SYNOPSIS
      my $list = new List::SkipList();

      $list->insert( 'key1', 'value' );
      $list->insert( 'key2', 'another value' );

      $value = $list->find('key2');

      $list->delete('key1');

DESCRIPTION
    This is an implementation of skip lists in Perl.  What are "skip
    lists"?

      Skip lists are a probabilistic data structure that seem likely
      to supplant balanced trees as the implementation method of
      choice for many applications. Skip list algorithms have the same
      asymptotic expected time bounds as balanced trees and are
      simpler, faster and use less space.(*)

    This particular implementation may not necessarily be faster or
    use less space, but in superficial testing, it does appear to be a
    reasonably faster substitute for some tree modules.  See the
    included Benchmark.txt file for comparisons with other Perl
    modules.

    Skip lists are similar to linked lists, except that they have
    random links at various levels that allow searches to skip over
    sections of the list, like so:

      4 +---------------------------> +----------------------> +
        |                             |                        |
      3 +------------> +------------> +-------> +-------> +--> +
        |              |              |         |         |    |
      2 +-------> +--> +-------> +--> +--> +--> +-------> +--> +
        |         |    |         |    |    |    |         |    |
      1 +--> +--> +--> +--> +--> +--> +--> +--> +--> +--> +--> +
             A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H    I    J   NIL

    A search would start at the top level: if the link to the right
    exceeds the target key, then it descends a level.

    More information is available in the module documentation.

    this distribution.

CAVEATS
    Skip lists are non-deterministic.  Because of this, bugs in programs
    that use this module may be subtle and difficult to reproduce without
    many repeated attempts.
