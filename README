NAME
    List::SkipList - Perl implementation of skip lists

REQUIREMENTS
    Perl 5.6.1 is required.

    "Carp::Assert" is used for validation and debugging. (The assertions can
    be commented out if the module cannot be installed.) Otherwise standard
    modules are used.

Installation
    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL or the
    newer Build.PL methods.

    Using Makefile.PL:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use nmake instead.)

    Using Build.PL (if you have Module::Build installed):

      perl Build.PL
      perl Build
      perl Build test
      perl Build install    

SYNOPSIS
      my $list = new List::SkipList();

      $list->insert( 'key1', 'value' );
      $list->insert( 'key2', 'another value' );

      $value = $list->find('key2');

      $list->delete('key1');

DESCRIPTION
    This is an implementation of skip lists in Perl.  What are "skip
    lists"?  From WikiPedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list>:

      Skip lists are a probabilistic data structure that seem likely
      to supplant balanced trees as the implementation method of
      choice for many applications. Skip list algorithms have the same
      asymptotic expected time bounds as balanced trees and are
      simpler, faster and use less space.

    (This particular implementation may not necessarily be faster or
    use less space, but in superficial testing, it does appear to be a
    reasonably faster substitute for some tree modules.)

    Skip lists are similar to linked lists, except that they have
    random links at various levels that allow searches to skip over
    sections of the list, like so:

      4 +---------------------------> +----------------------> +
        |                             |                        |
      3 +------------> +------------> +-------> +-------> +--> +
        |              |              |         |         |    |
      2 +-------> +--> +-------> +--> +--> +--> +-------> +--> +
        |         |    |         |    |    |    |         |    |
      1 +--> +--> +--> +--> +--> +--> +--> +--> +--> +--> +--> +
             A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H    I    J   NIL

    A search would start at the top level: if the link to the right
    exceeds the target key, then it descends a level.

    More information is available in the module documentation.

REVISION HISTORY
    Changes since v0.31:

    0.40  Wed Mar 17 2004
	- added Benchmark file to distribution
	* key_cmp now ignores when key is undefined
	- _insert returns the value of $node->key_cmp($key)
	- broke up test cases into separate files
	- added finger caching to speed up sequential inserts
	- fixed bugs with values, keys, copy, merge, first_key and next_key
          methods related to use of search fingers
	- fixed bug with append method
	- fixed bug with search fingers: they were not being used
	- _debug now prints to STDERR
	* reset method is not called when a new node is added or deleted
          (which is in accord with documentation)
	- stub for next method added
	- List::SkipList::Node ignores invalid and extra arguments
	- minor optimizations in List::SkipList and List::SkipList::Node
	- improved speed of _random_level
	- disabled assertions (for 50% speed improvement!)
	- inserted corrected comment in README about actual performance in
	  comparison to trees

    0.33  Tue Mar 16 2004
	- fixed typos in test cases that caused Makefile tests to fail
	- removed causes of warnings in 01-SkipList.t
	- replaced explicit package names with __PACKAGE__ placeholder

    0.32  Mon Mar 15 2004
	- renamed test.pl to t/01-SkipList.t
	- added Build.PL to distribution
        - updated README
	- corrected and updated POD

    Versions 0.32 and 0.33 were removed from CPAN because of problems
    found after uploading the modules.

    A detailed revision history is in the Changes file included with
    this distribution.

CAVEATS
    Skip lists are non-deterministic.  Because of this, bugs in programs
    that use this module may be subtle and difficult to reproduce without
    many repeated attempts.
