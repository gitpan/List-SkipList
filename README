NAME
    List::SkipList - Perl implementation of skip lists

SYNOPSIS
      my $list = new List::SkipList();

      $list->insert( 'key1', 'value' );
      $list->insert( 'key2', 'another value' );

      $value = $list->find('key2');

      $list->delete('key1');

DESCRIPTION
    This is a prototype implementation of skip lists in Perl. Skip lists are
    similar to linked lists, except that they have random links at various
    levels that allow searches to skip over sections of the list. They
    generally perform as well as balanced trees for searching but do not
    have the overhead with respect to inserting new items.

    More detailed information is available in the module documentation.
