    An unscientific comparison of module performance for List::SkipList
    against other pure-Perl modules:

                               Ordered   Random    
      Module         Version   Inserts   Inserts   Finds    Deletes

      List::SkipList   0.41    0.5007    0.6299    0.4607   0.5419
      Tree::Smart      0.01    0.3597    1.2823    1.0856   0.0100
      Tree::Ternary    0.03    1.2104    1.0404    0.4383   N/A

    Numbers in seconds per 1,000 operations on a set of randomly generated
    keys on a machine running Windows XP Professional, Pentium III 795 MHz,
    320 MB RAM.

    Also note that List::SkipList uses a non-deterministic (randomized)
    algorithm, so numbers will vary.
